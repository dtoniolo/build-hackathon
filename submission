# Submission  
### VC KPI Reporting Tool  

## Project Description  
A lightweight reporting tool for VCs to collect portfolio KPIs in a structured way, validate submissions, and generate investor-ready outputs.  

- **For founders**: upload KPIs via CSV/Excel, emails or a guided form, receive reminders, and get in-line validation and definitions to avoid errors  
- **For funds**: view live dashboards of submissions, track red flags (e.g. short runway), and export clean, structured data for LP reports  

This project was built in a single weekend hackathon sprint.  

### How to Use  
**Built today**  
1. Founders upload KPI data (CSV, Excel, email, or form input).  
2. System extracts and processes the data for structured storage.  
3. Manual entry option available for missing or corrected fields.  

**Planned scope (not yet built)**  
- Automated validation (missing fields, unusual values).  
- Fund team dashboards with submission status and portfolio views.  
- Export functionality for LP-ready reports.
